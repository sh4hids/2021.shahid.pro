I planned to make it minimal and focus on showcasing my open-source works and writings. As I was using gatsby and I open-sourced my site, I decided to build it as a gatsby theme.</p>\n<p>I had zero knowledge about developing a gatsby theme before starting the project. I started researching and found a great tutorial by Jason Lengstorf on <a href=\"https://egghead.io/courses/gatsby-theme-authoring\">egghead.io</a>. I followed the tutorial and <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/building-themes/\">documentation</a>, and managed to build a minimal theme in a couple of days. It was so easy that I felt almost like developing a gatsby site.</p>\n<p>I started by designing the theme in Figma with the <a href=\"https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/\">Atomic Design Pattern</a>. I made a design system with color, typography, shadow, and some components so that I don't have to remember the color name, font size while designing the pages. You can find the design on this <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/file/oHQ9wMCrJ8UqlHgLbGigCt/shahid.pro?node-id=0%3A1\">Figma link</a>.</p>\n<p>After completing the basic design, I started researching for a good name. My theme focuses on showcasing open-source projects. So, it would be great to have the word <code class=\"language-text\">open-source</code> in it. I remember developer <a href=\"https://github.com/ahmadawais\">Ahmad Awais</a> used to call him <code class=\"language-text\">OpenSourcerer</code>, and dev.to founder Ben Halpern also likes to call him <a href=\"https://dev.to/ben/job-title-full-time-open-sourcerer-1eh1\">full-time open sourcerer</a>. I checked on GitHub and Gatsby Plugin Library if the name already exists. It was available. So, I named my theme <a href=\"https://github.com/sh4hids/gatsby-theme-open-sourcerer\">gatsby-theme-open-sourcerer</a>.</p>\n<p>Now let's have a look at the theme.</p>\n<h2 id=\"features\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#features\" aria-label=\"features permalink\" class=\"header-anchor-icon before\"><svg version=\"1.1\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\" viewBox=\"0 0 162.656 162.656\" xml:space=\"preserve\" width=\"0.6em\" height=\"0.6em\" fill=\"#21AAE2\" stroke=\"#21AAE2\" stroke-width=\"0\"><path d=\"M151.764,10.894c-14.522-14.522-38.152-14.525-52.676-0.008l0.003,0.003L76.112,33.872l10.607,10.605l22.983-22.988 l-0.002-0.002c8.678-8.663,22.785-8.658,31.457,0.014c8.673,8.672,8.672,22.786,0,31.461l-34.486,34.484 c-4.201,4.202-9.787,6.516-15.729,6.516c-5.942,0-11.529-2.314-15.73-6.516L64.605,98.052c7.035,7.035,16.389,10.91,26.338,10.91 c9.949,0,19.303-3.875,26.335-10.91l34.487-34.484C166.284,49.043,166.284,25.413,151.764,10.894z\"></path> <path d=\"M52.96,141.162L52.96,141.162c-8.675,8.67-22.788,8.668-31.461-0.005c-8.673-8.675-8.673-22.791-0.001-31.465L55.98,75.21 c8.675-8.674,22.789-8.674,31.462,0L98.05,64.604c-14.524-14.523-38.154-14.524-52.676,0L10.89,99.086 c-14.519,14.523-14.519,38.154,0.001,52.678c7.263,7.262,16.801,10.893,26.341,10.892c9.536,0,19.074-3.629,26.333-10.887 l0.002-0.001l22.984-22.99l-10.608-10.606L52.96,141.162z\"></path> </svg></a>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>minimal in design</li>\n<li>markdown support for writing post</li>\n<li>page contents in <code class=\"language-text\">YAML</code> format</li>\n<li>open-source project showcasing with GitHub star count</li>\n<li>fully customizable</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"installation\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#installation\" aria-label=\"installation permalink\" class=\"header-anchor-icon before\"><svg version=\"1.1\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\" viewBox=\"0 0 162.656 162.656\" xml:space=\"preserve\" width=\"0.6em\" height=\"0.6em\" fill=\"#21AAE2\" stroke=\"#21AAE2\" stroke-width=\"0\"><path d=\"M151.764,10.894c-14.522-14.522-38.152-14.525-52.676-0.008l0.003,0.003L76.112,33.872l10.607,10.605l22.983-22.988 l-0.002-0.002c8.678-8.663,22.785-8.658,31.457,0.014c8.673,8.672,8.672,22.786,0,31.461l-34.486,34.484 c-4.201,4.202-9.787,6.516-15.729,6.516c-5.942,0-11.529-2.314-15.73-6.516L64.605,98.052c7.035,7.035,16.389,10.91,26.338,10.91 c9.949,0,19.303-3.875,26.335-10.91l34.487-34.484C166.284,49.043,166.284,25.413,151.764,10.894z\"></path> <path d=\"M52.96,141.162L52.96,141.162c-8.675,8.67-22.788,8.668-31.461-0.005c-8.673-8.675-8.673-22.791-0.001-31.465L55.98,75.21 c8.675-8.674,22.789-8.674,31.462,0L98.05,64.604c-14.524-14.523-38.154-14.524-52.676,0L10.89,99.086 c-14.519,14.523-14.519,38.154,0.001,52.678c7.263,7.262,16.801,10.893,26.341,10.892c9.536,0,19.074-3.629,26.333-10.887 l0.002-0.001l22.984-22.99l-10.608-10.606L52.96,141.162z\"></path> </svg></a>Installation</h2>\n<p>A site can be bootstrapped easily with the theme by using the starter kit.
